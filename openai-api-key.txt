### fr0gger's notes on how to use powershell to use environment variables for openai api key

# set an environment variable (more secure way to handle API keys in code)
# you may need to restart vscode & terminal to pick up the new env variable
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "<your api key>"

# to list all variables or just the new variable
Get-ChildItem Env: OR Get-ChildItem Env: | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "OPENAI_*" }

# to remove the new variable:
Remove-Item Env:OPENAI_API_KEY
